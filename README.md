## Project Overview

The project aims to predict the price of Bitcoin over 1-minute candlesticks. Due to the lack of proper hardware, this is accomplished using supervised-learning methods only.

## Features

- **Live Price Prediction**: Predicts the close, low, & high aspects of the current 1-minute candlestick using three supervised models

  (`linear regression`, `elastic net optimized using grid search`, `logistic regression`) running in parallel.
- **Web Interface**: Web interface that demonstrates the predictions and the actual values visually.
- **Multiprocessing**: Runs each model as a separate process to enhance efficiency and serve the live predictions in a timely fashion.
- **Multithreading**: API requests are ran in separate threads to save time.
- **Automatic Data Fetching**: Uses Kaggle's CroissantML format and other public APIs to automatically download and store the data in parquet format.
- **Web Scraping**: Utilizes a Socks-5 proxy through a local TOR browser instance to scrape live news from the DuckDuckGo.
- **Live Sentiment Analysis**: The scraped news articles are fed into [FinBERT](https://huggingface.co/ProsusAI/finbert) to get live sentiment.
- **Live Data Collection**: Live data is collected from various sources including Binance, CoinStats, & YahooFinanace.

## Data Sources

The models require two forms of data:

### Training Data
**Used for training and testing the models.**
Sources include:


### Live Data
**Used for acquiring the necessary information to predict the targets.**
Sources include:


## Installation

1. You must have 
1. Create a `config.json` file in the root directory of the project. The structure of the file must match that of `example_config.json`.
2. [Optional] Create a virtual python environment and initialize it.
3. Install the project requirements by running the following command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    - Note that this project requires Python 3.11.8 and on some systems you must run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

1. Change into the project directory and start the server by `python .` or `python3 .`
2. Access the web interface at `http://127.0.0.1:{PORT FROM config.json}`.
